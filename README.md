# server-client task
## Dependency:
* MSVC 2019 (14.2)
* Boost - 1.81.0
It needs that boost was installed in a folder (C:\boost\boost_1_81_0)
## This one has *big issue*. When server trying to return data after request from client, the server and client do not work correctly and freeze, I think that I need to rework the client, but there is no time for this
